                    <p class="text"><br></p>
                    <p class="text">A CFD (contract for difference) trading involves many types of contracts covering a
                        diverse set of markets including shares, indices, commodities and treasuries. </p>
                    <p class="text"><br></p>
                    <p class="text">Forex is a de-centralized global market where the world’s currencies are
                        exchanged. </p>
                    <p class="text"><br></p>
                    <p class="text">CFD trading and Forex are speculative and involves a high degree of risk and can
                        result in the loss of your entire investment. Therefore, trading in CFD and Forex is appropriate
                        only for persons who understand and are willing to assume the economic, legal and other risks
                        involved in such transactions.</p>
                    <p class="text"><br></p>
                    <p class="text">You should be satisfied that CFD and Forex trading is suitable for you in light of
                        your financial circumstances and attitude towards risk. You should not engage in speculative CFD
                        and Forex trading unless you understand the basic aspects of such trading and its risks. If you
                        are in any doubt as to whether CFD and Forex trading is appropriate and suitable for you, please
                        seek independent advice from a financial consulting professional, as 'CryptoGuard' does
                        not provide such advice.</p>
                    <p class="text"><br></p>

                        prior to applying for engaging in Forex and CFD Trading with 'CryptoGuard' and our
                        selected brokers and prior to making any individual order.</p>
                    <p class="text"><br></p>

                        consultation from an independent Financial Advisor. If the Client continues to not understand
                        the risks involved in trading in CFDs and Forex, the Client should not trade at all.</p>

                    <p class="text">Consequently, engaging in CFD and Forex trading may expose you to substantially
